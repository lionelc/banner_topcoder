1. I modified the banner_source code 
2. Also, in its dependent library Mallet, I modified the source code of it too and thereby replaced the jar file in lib directory of banner_source. 

The new jar file is enclosed in lib: mallet.jar

The modified source code of mallet is also enclosed (src directory only), and the entire package can be downloaded at 

http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/dist/mallet-2.0.6.tar.gz

This solution runs better than the default on the validation data set (score visible to contestants immediately), with a submission score 821119.94.
